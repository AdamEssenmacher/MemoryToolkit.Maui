# Overview

MAUI leaks like a toddler's sippy cup. It's messy, gross, and feels hopelessly unavoidable.

MemoryToolkit.Maui offers three primary features to help manage this problem:

- **Detects leaks** in MAUI views as they happen.
- **Prevents certain classes of leaks** by automatically applying certain tear down measures.
- **Compartmentalizes leaks** by breaking apart the visual tree, ensuring small leaks do not grow to consume their host pages.

# Quick Start
## Install

```nuget install AdamE.MemoryToolkit.Maui```

## Configure leak detection
Update `MauiProgram.cs`. Note, this is only required for leak detection. `TearDownBehavior` does not require configuration.
```c#
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    MauiAppBuilder builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
    builder
        .UseMauiApp<App>();
    //...

#if DEBUG
    // Configure logging
    builder.Logging.AddDebug();
    
    // Ensure UseLeakDetection is called after logging has been configured!
    builder.UseLeakDetection(collectionTarget =>
    {
        // This callback will run any time a leak is detected.
        Application.Current?.MainPage?.DisplayAlert("üí¶Leak Detectedüí¶",
            $"‚ùóüßü‚ùó{collectionTarget.Name} is a zombie!", "OK");
    });
#endif

    return builder.Build();
}
```

## Detect leaks
Get started detecting leaks at runtime by adding the `LeakMonitorBehavior.Cascade` attached property to your views.
```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:mtk="clr-namespace:MemoryToolkit.Maui;assembly=MemoryToolkit.Maui"
             x:Class="ShellSample.MainPage"
             mtk:LeakMonitorBehavior.Cascade="True">
    <!-- All child views are now monitored for leaks. -->
</ContentPage>
```

If you're lucky enough to have no leaks, you should see info logs like:

If you're not so lucky, you'll see warnings like:

If you've configured the callback as demonstrated above, you'll also see a runtime alert:

## Fix leaks
Once leaks have been detected, you can make sure they are automatically compartmentalized--and possibly even fixed--by adding the `TearDownBehavior.Cascade` attached property.

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:mtk="clr-namespace:MemoryToolkit.Maui;assembly=MemoryToolkit.Maui"
             x:Class="ShellSample.MainPage"
             mtk:LeakMonitorBehavior.Cascade="True"
             mtk:TearDownBehavior.Cascade="True">
    <!-- All child views are now automatically torn down. -->
</ContentPage>
```
Note: When using both `LeakMonitorBehavior` and `TearDownBehavior`, make sure `TearDownBehavior` comes after `LeakMonitorBehavior` in the XAML.

## Warning!
While leak prevention & compartmentalization features are intended to be safe for production use, you might not want to use leak detection in release builds due to excessive `GC.Collect()` calls needed to get the GC to behave deterministically.

# User Guide

Warning: since the `LeakMonitorBehavior` works by walking the visual tree on Unload, it will **not** detect leaking subviews that may have been dynamically removed from the parent view. In these cases, consider adding another `LeakMonitorBehavior.Cascade` property to the subview.

## Suppressing Behaviors
Both `LeakMonitorBehavior` and `TearDownBehavior` offer an attached property `Suppress` that can be set to 'true' to exclude any view (and its subviews) from the effects of the behavior. This can be useful in cases where you're already aware of a leak and wish to suppress further warnings. Or perhaps you may not actually expect that view to be automatically monitored or torn down according to our definition of 'done with' (for example, for view caching).

## Custom Teardown Hook
In some cases, known leaks may be worked around by whacking the control into a safe state when we're done with it. For example, an `SKLottieView` from SkiaSharp once leaked as long as its `IsAnimationEnabled` property was set to True. The `TearDownBehavior` class offers a static `Action<object>` property `OnTearDown` that is invoked immediately before each call to `DisconnectHandler()`. You may use this hook to examine the view and change its state (for example, to set an `SKLottieView`'s `IsAnimationEnabled` property to 'false').

## Temporarily Unloaded NavigationPages
There are a few common-enough scenarios where you'll expect a `NavigationPage` to be unloaded only temporarily. For example, calling `Browser.OpenAsync(..)`. In these cases, you can temporarily set the 'Suppress' properties on the `NavigationPage` itself, which will cause all behaviors within the page to be ignored. Here's an example handler method:
```csharp
private void OnTapped(object? sender, TappedEventArgs e)
{
    var navigationPage = Utilities.GetFirstSelfOrParentOfType<NavigationPage>(this);
    if (navigationPage == null)
        return;

    LeakMonitorBehavior.SetSuppress(navigationPage, true);
    TearDownBehavior.SetSuppress(navigationPage, true);
}
```
Be sure to set the 'Suppress' properties back to false later. The view's `Loaded` event is probably a good place for that.

## ControlTemplates
A common use of the `ControlTemplate` is to change the appearance of a control at run time. For example, https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView uses different control templates to show different views based on some loading state (e.g. loading, loaded, error). Whenever ControlTemplates are being used in this way, it's a good idea to use the above attached properties on a per-template basis.

# How It Works

## Understanding the Underlying Problem
There are two core architectural issues behind MAUI's systemic memory problem.

### Problem 1: Poor leak compartmentalization
Memory leaks spread through MAUI pages like a zombie virus. Out of the box, they'll typically compartmentalize at the Page level. Meaning, **a leak of any size will grow to consume its entire host page**. This is _bad news_... particularly for `NavigationPages`! Naval vessels are built with compartmentalized designs to prevent a minor leak from becoming a catastrophic one. MAUI's design makes no attempt to contain leaks when they happen.

### Problem 2: Poor component lifecycle management
Individual controls (e.g. `ListView`, `Border`, `Entry`, etc.) may be implemented in such a way that they **require** explicit cleanup (i.e. via calls to `DisconnectHandler()` and/or `Dispose()` to avoid memory leaks. (This is particularly true on Apple platforms where cyclic references are not handled by the garbage collector.) It is _critical_ that these cleanup methods are called, but MAUI provides no mechanism (such as a standard component lifecycle) to do so for you. They say that this is "by design". The justification is that MAUI should not make any assumptions about when the developer is 'done with' a given element. For example, a view might be cached or getting moved between pages. Even if we accept this argument, MAUI _still_ doesn't offer developers a standard mechanism to easily and intentionally manage this problem.

## Defining 'done with'

Lacking an officially supported view lifecycle management mechanism, MemoryToolkit.Maui makes some guesses on when developers are usually 'done with' a view. This condition is considered met when any of the following are true:

- The `Element`'s `Page` (or itself, if the `Element` is a `Page`) was just popped off the navigation stack.
- The `Element` has been unloaded and is not (or no longer) hosted within a `Page` (e.g. a `ControlTemplate` that was just swapped out).
- The `Element` is hosted within a `NavigationPage` that has been unloaded (this can be temporarily ignored; see the 'Advanced Use' section below).

Out of the box, MemoryToolkit.Maui uses this definition to automatically apply leak monitoring, prevention, and compartmentalization features.

This definition is likely incomplete (we probably need to consider things like nested modal navigation and tabbed pages), but I think it's a good starting point. In cases where this definition doesn't apply (e.g. cached pages), MemoryToolkit.Maui still offers tools so developers can take direct control over monitoring and managing component lifecycles.

## How does TearDownBehavior work?
While quite effective, `TearDownBehavior.Cascade` is an extremely destructive tool. As such, it's important that you understand what it does. If it runs prematurely, it _will_ bork your app.

### Phase 1) Clearing BindingContext
`TearDownBehavior` clears the `BindingContext` from views automatically, which helps prevent leaks from spreading to view models. This also tends to 'whack' the view into a near-default state, which can avoid a certain class of memory leaks.

### Phase 2) Compartmentalization
The behavior next does its best to remove any references each view has to other views. It does this by setting certain properties to null (such as `ItemsSource`, `Content`, and `Parent`) and calling `ClearLogicalChildren()`. If this step fails to remove references to other objects, the leak will spread. I expect that this process will improve as MemoryToolkit.Maui matures.

### Phase 3) Handler Cleanup
After giving the platform handlers their chance to react to a now-empty and isolated view, `TearDownBehavior` calls `Dispose()` (if applicable) and then `DisconnectHandler()` on the view's Handler. Other targeted cleanup measures are also applied to address known leaks in MAUI.


# Sample App
A sample MAUI project is included that demonstrates the severity of the issue, along with the toolkit's ability to detect and eliminate it. **The demonstration is meant to be run on iOS.**

## Observe a Leak
The sample is a Shell app with a simple page that shows a scrollable list of 100 random photos from https://picsum.photos. Two buttons allow you to either push a new instance of the page on the navigation stack, or pop the current page. The current (managed) heap size is also displayed:

<img src="https://github.com/AdamEssenmacher/MemoryToolkit.Maui/assets/8496021/9d5c8a60-5bc8-4b2a-aec5-25826e412bd7" height="200">

Right off the bat, the app consumes ~38 MB of managed memory. An empty MAUI app uses ~7-8MB (at least on iOS). The other 30 MB is artificial for the sake of demonstration. The `ListView`'s `ItemSource` property has been set to a collection of mocked-out 'view model' objects that each contain a 300KB byte array. Most view models probably won't be this big naturally, but it's definitely in the realm of possibility. Also, it's important to realize that the sample app is not reporting on memory used on the native side, which could easily be a couple 100 KB per item since we're showing images. The point here is that while the situation is contrived, it fairly demonstrates how available memory is quickly consumed by a MAUI app.

To demonstrate a leak for yourself, push & pop the page a few times. Each time you push, you'll see that our heap size increases by ~30 MB. This is expected given our contrived design--we need each page to stay in memory so we can return to it later via the 'Pop' button. These actions simulate a user navigating to and away from pages in your app.

After several push/pop cycles, the heap size will increase to several hundred MB. This is a _lot_ for a mobile app, and will eventually lead to the OS terminating it.

## Detect Leaks
You might have noticed in the previous test that the on-screen "Leaks Detected" counter remains at 0. This is because we haven't enabled the leak detection feature of the toolkit yet. Open `MainPage.xaml` and change the value of the attached property `mtk:LeakMonitorBehavior.Cascade="False"` to 'True' and re-run your test. You'll notice that each time you push a new page, no new leaks are detected. However, each time you pop a page, several dozen leaks will be detected after a short delay (even more if you've scrolled around a bit).

If you check out your debug output, you'll also see that each leaked Element / Handler has been logged as a warning.

## Prevent Leaks
To prevent leaks, open `MainPage.xaml` and change the value of the attached property `mtk:TearDownBehavior.Cascade="False"` to 'True' and re-run your test. You'll notice that each time you pop a page, the number of leaks detected will be 0. This is because the toolkit is now automatically tearing down each page as it's popped off the navigation stack. You'll also notice that managed memory usage is now stable at ~38 MB.
